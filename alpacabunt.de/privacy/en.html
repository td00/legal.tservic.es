<h2>5. Analysis tools and advertising</h2>
<h3>Matomo</h3> <p>This website uses the open-source web analysis service Matomo.</p> <p>Through Matomo, we are able to collect and analyze data on the use of our website-by-website visitors. This enables us to find out, for instance, when which page views occurred and from which region they came. In addition, we collect various log files (e.g. IP address, referrer, browser, and operating system used) and can measure whether our website visitors perform certain actions (e.g. clicks, purchases, etc.).</p> <p>The use of this analysis tool is based on Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in the analysis of user patterns, in order to optimize the operator&rsquo;s web offerings and advertising. If appropriate consent has been obtained, the processing is carried out exclusively on the basis of Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR and &sect; 25 (1) TTDSG, insofar the consent includes the storage of cookies or the access to information in the user&rsquo;s end device (e.g., device fingerprinting) within the meaning of the TTDSG. This consent can be revoked at any time.</p>
<h4>IP anonymization</h4> <p>For analysis with Matomo we use IP anonymization. Your IP address is shortened before the analysis, so that it is no longer clearly assignable to you.</p>
<h4>Analysis without cookies</h4> <p>We have configured Matomo in such a way that Matomo will not store cookies in your browser.</p>
<h4>Hosting</h4> <p>We host Matomo exclusively on our own servers so that all analysis data remains with us and is not passed on.</p>
